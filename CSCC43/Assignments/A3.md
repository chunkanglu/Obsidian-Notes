## 1.1 Assumptions
- Assuming all series and matches are in the same tournament
- Assuming 1 match a day for a series (between two teams)
- Assuming we can uniquely identify a match by series and match number (series identifies which two teams competing and match number for which series match)
- Assuming all teams have at least 1 coach and a coach can work with multiple teams (possibly at different times)
- Assuming no restrictions on number of players in hockey team (since ER diagram cannot strictly enforce)
- Assuming that first name, surname, and date of birth is enough to uniquely identify players and coaches
- Team needs a teamID attribute as there are no attributes that can be used for identification
- Referee needs a refID attribute as we do not store Date of Birth for referee and there are no other substitutions that will guarantee us unique identification 
## 1.2

For this subquestion, I introduced unique ID values for each entity (if they did not have one before) for easier referential constraints. Although it is possible to use the keys as in the first subquestion, it is much more convenient to use unique IDs for relationships between entities.
$$
\begin{align}
Match(&\underline{matchID}, Series, Match Number, TournamentDay, Referee, Team1, Team2, \\
&DateDay, DateMonth, DateYear, HomeCity, HomeTeam, InHomeCity, \\
&VariationCity, ReasonForVariation, IsPostponed, PostponedDay, PostponedMonth, PostponedYear)
\end{align}
$$
$Referee(\underline{refID}, Firstname, Surname, CityOfBirth, RegionOfBirth )$
$Team(\underline{teamID})$
$Coach(\underline{coachID}, Firstname, Surname, DateOfBirth, Salary)$
$CoachContract(\underline{Coach, Team}, DateOfCommencement, StartDate, EndDate)$
$Player(\underline{playerID}, Firstname, Surname, DateOfBirth, CityOfBirth, MainPosition)$
$PlayerContract(\underline{Player, Team}, DateOfCommencement, StartDate, EndDate)$
$TournamentPoints(\underline{TournamentDay, Team}, Points)$
$PlayerPosition(\underline{Match, Player}, Position)$
$$
\begin{align}
Match(Referee) &\subseteq Referee(refID) \\
Match(Team1) &\subseteq Team(teamID) \\
Match(Team2) &\subseteq Team(teamID) \\
CoachContract(Team) &\subseteq Team(teamID) \\
CoachContract(Coach) &\subseteq Coach(coachID) \\
PlayerContract(Team) &\subseteq Team(teamID) \\
PlayerContract(Player) &\subseteq Player(playerID) \\
TournamentPoints(TournamentDay) &\subseteq Match(TournamentDay) \\
TournamentPoints(Team) &\subseteq Team(teamID) \\
PlayerPosition(Match) &\subseteq Match(matchID) \\
PlayerPosition(Player) &\subseteq Player(playerID) \\
\end{align}
$$
## Q2
![[Pasted image 20231201213721.png]]
The entity TRAINROUTE is redundant with TRAINTIMETABLE as TrainNumber in TRAINROUTE is a subset of Number in TRAINTIMETABLE due to the referential constraint and it would not make sense if there is the same TrainNumber and Number whilst the To and From attributes between the two entities do not align. Thus there must be a one-to-one correspondence between TRAINROUTE and TRAINTIMETABLE that is fully redundant.

## Q2
$R(ABCDE)$
### 2a
$ACD, CDE, BCD$
### 2b
Assume in 1NF.
Note that all of $A, B, C, D, E$ are prime attributes, since they are each in at least $1$ key of $R$.
By definition, $R$ is in 2NF.
$R$ is in 3NF since all RHS attributes of the functional dependency are prime attributes.
### 2c
We have the following functional dependencies: $F = \{ A \to B, BC \to E, ED \to A \}$
$R$ is not BCNF since it is not the case that for every FD, its LHS ($A, BC, ED$) is a superkey of $R$ since the keys of $R$ are $ACD, CDE, BCD$.
## Q3
### 3a
#### ai
$B$
#### aii
Prime attributes: $B$
Non-Prime Attributes: $A, C, D$
If we assume that no attributes are composite/multi-valued, then $R$ is 1NF.
Since there is a single key, trivially no parts of it derive a non-prime attribute, thus $R$ is 2NF.
$R$ is not 3NF since non-prime attribute $D$ is derived from another non-prime attribute $C$.
Thus $R$ is 2NF.
#### aiii
Decompose $R(ABCD)$ into:
- $R_1(ACD)$, relevant FD $C \to D, C \to A$
	- Key is $C$
	- This relation is 3NF and BCNF since LHS of relevant FD is always a superkey
- $R_2(BC)$, relevant FD $B \to C$
	- Key is $B$
	- This relation is 3NF and BCNF since LHS of relevant FD is always a superkey
Final BCNF decomposition: $R_1(ACD), R_2(BC)$
### 3b
#### bi
$BD$
#### bii
Prime attributes: $B, D$
Non-Prime Attributes: $A, C$
If we assume that no attributes are composite/multi-valued, then $R$ is 1NF.
It is not 2NF since parts of the key derive a non-prime attribute ($B \to C, D \to A$).
Thus $R$ is 1NF.
#### biii
Decompose $R(ABCD)$ into
- $R_1(BC)$, relevant FD $B \to C$
	- Key is $B$
	- This is trivially 2NF as there are no parts of the single prime attribute $B$

- $R_2(ABD)$, relevant FD $D \to A$
	- Key is $BD$
	- This is not 2NF since part of the key derives a non-prime attribute
	- Decompose into
		- $R_3(AD)$, relevant FD $D \to A$
			- Key is $D$
			- This is trivially 2NF since there are no parts of the single prime attribute $D$
			- This is 3NF and BCNF since LHS of relevant FD $D$ is a superkey
		- $R_4(BD)$
			- This is trivially BCNF as there are no relevant FD for this relation

### 3c
#### ci
$AB, CD$
#### cii
Prime attributes: $A, B, C, D$
Non-Prime Attributes: None
If we assume that no attributes are composite/multi-valued, then $R$ is 1NF.
$R$ is trivially 2NF as there are no non-prime attributes.
$R$ is 3NF since RHS of every functional dependency is a prime attribute.
$R$ is not BCNF since for FD $C \to A, D \to B$, LHS is not a superkey.
Thus $R$ is 3NF.
#### ciii
Decompose $R(ABCD)$ into
- $R_1(AC)$, relevant FD $C \to A$
	- Key is $C$
	- This is BCNF since LHS of relevant FD is a superkey
- $R_2(BCD)$, relevant FD $D \to B$
	- Key is $CD$
	- This is not BCNF since LHS of relevant FD $D$ is not a superkey
	- Decompose into
		- $R_3(DB)$
			-  This is BCNF since LHS of relevant FD is a superkey

#### aii
Prime attributes: $A, B, C, D, E$
Non-Prime Attributes: None
If we assume that no attributes are composite/multi-valued, then $R$ is 1NF.

$R$ is already 3NF as RHS of all functional dependencies are prime attributes
### 4b

$CD$
#### bii
Prime attributes: $C, D$
Non-Prime Attributes: $A, B, E, F$
If we assume that no attributes are composite/multi-valued, then $S$ is 1NF.
$S$ is not 2NF since part of keys derive non-prime attributes: $C \to A, D \to F$
Decompose:
- $S_1(CAB)$, relevant FD $C \to A$ ($A \to B$ does not influence normalization)
	- Key is $C$
	- Trivially 2NF since no partial dependency 
	- Is 3NF since LHS of relevant FD is a superkey
- $S_2(CDEF)$, relevant FD $CD \to E, D \to F$
	- Key is $CD$
	- Still not 2NF
	- Decompose
		- $S_3(DF)$, relevant FD $D \to F$
			- Key is $D$
			- Trivially 2NF since no parts of singular key
			- Is 3NF since LHS of relevant FD is a superkey
		- $S_4(CDE)$, relevant FD $CD \to E$
			- Key is $CD$

Decompose
- $T_1(ACD)$, relevant FD $A \to CD$
	- Key is $A$

## Q5
### 5a
### ai
All MVD using transitivity and complementation properties:
$$
\begin{align}
A &\twoheadrightarrow B \\
B &\twoheadrightarrow CD \\
A &\twoheadrightarrow CD \\
B &\twoheadrightarrow A
\end{align}
$$
### aii
As there are no functional dependencies, the key of $R$ is all attributes $ABCD$ and is also trivially BCNF.
By transitivity we get MVD, $A \twoheadrightarrow CD$
$R_1(AB)$
- No MVD in this relation as there are only 2 attributes
$R_2(ACD)$
- Relevant MVD $A \twoheadrightarrow CD$, must decompose
- $R_3(AC)$
- $R_4(AD)$
Final decomposition: $R_1(AB)$, $R_3(AC)$, $R_4(AD)$
### 5b
#### bi
Key of $R$ is $ABC$.
Prime attributes: $A, B, C$
Non-Prime attributes: $D, E$
Not in 2NF since part of key derives non-prime attribute: $A \to D, AB \to E$
However, in the decomposition process for MVD, we will also be able to decompose it into 3NF.

All MVD using transitivity and complementation properties as well as knowing every FD is also an MVD:
$$
\begin{align}
A &\twoheadrightarrow B \\
A &\twoheadrightarrow D \\
A &\twoheadrightarrow BCE \\
A &\twoheadrightarrow CDE \\
AB &\twoheadrightarrow E \\
AB &\twoheadrightarrow C \\
AB &\twoheadrightarrow DE \\
AB &\twoheadrightarrow CD \\
\end{align}
$$
To remove MVD $A \twoheadrightarrow B$, decompose:
- $R_1(AB)$
	- Key is $AB$
	- This has no MVD as it is 2 attributes
	- This has no relevant FD and is trivially 3NF
	- Thus is 4NF
- $R_2(ACDE)$
	- Key is $ACDE$
	- Decompose to remove remaining relevant MVD $A \twoheadrightarrow D$
		- $R_3(AD)$
			- Key is $A$
			- This has no MVD as it is 2 attributes
			- Is 2NF since single value key (no parts)
			- Is 3NF since LHS of relevant FD $A \to D$ is a superkey
			- Thus is 4NF
		- $R_4(ACE)$
			- Key is $ACE$
			- This has no MVD
			- Is trivially 3NF as there are no relevant FD
			- Thus is 4NF
Final Decomposition: $R_1(AB), R_3(AD), R_4(ACE)$
## Q6
### 6a
Consider the following relation:

| A | B | C |
|---|---|---|
| a | b | d |
| a | c | e |
Clearly $A \twoheadrightarrow BC$, however since tuples $(a, c, d)$ and $(a, b, e)$ do not exist, it is not the case that $A \twoheadrightarrow B$.
### 6b
$A \to B$ means that every $A$ value directly determines a $B$ value. $A \twoheadrightarrow B$ means every $A$ value can correspond to $\ge 1$ $B$ value. Thus due to conflicting definitions, this is clearly false. A trivial counterexample to showcase this is:

| A | B |
|---|---|
| a | b |
| a | c |

$A \twoheadrightarrow B$ but not $A \to B$
