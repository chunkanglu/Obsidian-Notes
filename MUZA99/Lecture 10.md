	- we respond differently to water in different situations (drink water, avoid rain)
	- semi-conscious
- **Musical entrainment**: aligning or intergrating bodily features with a recurrent feature in the soundscape (music)
	- how easy it is to move body to the music
	- body reacts to regular pulse, gestures (rising/ falling phrasis harmonic structures (chords))
	- body often musically entrained in dance
	- can also entrain physiological states, behaviours, social role
- Music in aerobics
	- people involved
		- production companies
		- instructor
		- class members

- **Intrauterine symphony:**: sounds in the uterus (mother's heartbeat, voice, sounds from outside world hear from in the womb)
	- one of key mechanism for achieving homeostatis is entrainment
		- regulation of physical and behavioural processes like breathing
- Music is effective for stabilizing physiological state
# Sound, Timbre, and Texture Revisited
- **Audio mixing**: process of digitizing, editing and combining individual tracks in a typically multitrack recording
	- balancing levels, EQ, panning, effects
- EQ
	- **Treble frequencies**: high freq
	- **Bass frequencies:** low freq
- Sound engineer
	- mixing engineers, mastering engineers
- Effects
	- **Reverb**: reproduces spatial sound of environment
	- **Delay**: repeats of a signal
- **DAW:** digital audio workstation
