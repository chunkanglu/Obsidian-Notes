# Sound and Timbre
## Sound
- *Sound* - broad term including noise and music
- *Noise* - usually negative connotation, unpleasant or disturbing sounds
- *Music* - organized, pleasing, harmonious sound, with conventions of genre and form
- **Acoustics:** the science of the production, propagation and preception of sound
- Sound waves
	- characterized by amplitude, wavelength
	- basic waveforms sine, square, triangle, sawtooth
- Sound envelope
	- changes in sound through time
	- **ADSR**
		- attack
			- time from silence to peak
		- decay
		- sustain
			- level maintained before release
		- release
- **Dynamics:** aspect of music relating to loudness
	- **Forte:** loud
	- **Mezzo-forte**: moderately loud
	- **Mezzo-piano**: moderately soft
	- **Piano:** soft
	- Fortissimo / Pianissimo: very loud / very soft
	- Forte possibile piano possibile: as loud / quiet as possible
	- Niente: nothing, silence
## Timbre
- Pitch: perceived quality of a sound as function of fundamental frequency
- Tone: a sound of definite pitch
- **Timbre:** the character or quality of a sound (tone colour)
- Frequency: number of complete vibrations or cycle s occurring per unit of time
- Describing music like colour
	- dark, bright
	- warm, cool
	- shading (dynamic shading)
	- sound painting
	- soundscape
- Synaestasia: phenomenon which causese the brain to route sensory information thorught unrelated senses (hearing colours, tasting words)
- Choose timbre to best express the meaning behind the musical idea
- Arranging / orchestration involves using different instruments to play the same themes
	- only considered instrumentation in Baroque period
- **Harmonic series:** sequence of frequencies (harmonics), which are *multiples* of the fundamental frequency
	- different harmonics are louder for different sounds which contribute to the timbre
	- *Overtone:* harmonics above the fundamental
## Texture
- **Texture:** general pattern of sound created by the elements of music
	- blend of the sounds and melodic lones occurring simultaneously in a piece of music
	- can be thought of as a themem in and of itself
- 3 species of texture (characteristic of European classical music)
	- **monophonic**
		- consisting of a single line or melody without accompaniment
		- often monophonic music suggests harmony (even whhen chords not explicitly played)
		- can be used briefly to concentrate attention on a single melodic line
	- **homophonic**
		- melodic interest is concentrated in one voice part that is provided with subordinate accompaniment
			- includes instrument and vocal music (very common)
		- countermelody: piece whose texture consists clearly of a melody with accompaniment, where accompanying part has distinct, subordinate melodic interest
		- Chordal homophony: form of homophony in which all parts move together, forming succession of chords
	- **polyphonic**
		- music that combines several distince melodic lines simultaneously
		- each line retain their identity, interest is ditributed between all parts of the texture
		- encourage audiences to listen deeper with greater sensitivity to texture
