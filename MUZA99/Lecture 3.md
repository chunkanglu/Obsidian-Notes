# European Classical Music Notation (not tested, just context)
- roots to monasteries in southern Europe in 9th century
- *Neumes:* graphic signs indicating the rise and fall of a melody sung by voice
- notation evolved so singers can sight read
- 14th century placed on likes
- 15th century gets much closer to what we use now
# Melody
- **Note:** a pitch
	- symbol used in musical notation to represent the duration of sound, and only when place upon a staff, to indicate its pitch
	- like a letter in language
- *Pitch:* the perceived quality of a sound as a function of its fundamental frequency
- Use letter names to refre to specific notes
- **Interval:** distance between two notes
	- smaller intervals *steps* (2nd)
	- larger intervals *leaps* (anything above 3rd)
- **Octave**: large (8-note) interval bounded by two notes with the same name: the frequency of the higher note is twice that of the lower note
- Interval ratios
	- octave 2:1
	- fifth 3:2
	- ...
- **Scale:** collection of notes arranged in order from lowest to highest or highest to lowest
	- made up of intervals typically steps from one note to the next
	- Common scales
		- major (7 notes)
		- natural minor (7 notes)
		- major pentatonic (5 notes)
		- minor pentatonic (5 notes)
		- Chromatic
			- using all 12 notes within the octave
		- Whole tone scale
			- using six notes, dividing the octave into siz equal parts
		- Harmonic minor scale
			- related to the natural minor scale, with a raised 7th degree
	- Solfege: a method of singing scales using solmization syllables
		- do, re, mi, fa, so ,la, ti
	- Solmization: system of associating notes with syllables, used commonly in education settings
	- Greek Modes
		- scales starting on different degrees
		- Modes
			- Ionian
			- Dorian
			- Phrygian
			- Lydian
			- Mixolydia
			- Aeolian
			- Locrian
- **Contour:** shape of a melody
	- **Ascending** rising melody or section of a melody
	- **Descending**
- **Range:** the span of notes from highest to lowest
- Types of melodic motion
	- Conjunct: melodic motion proceeding by step (small step melodies)
		- **Can't take my eyes off your by Lauryn Hill**
	- Disjunct: melodic motion with mainly leaps
		- **So what by Miles Davis**
- Phrase: self-contained portion of a melody
	- antecedent: first phrase, a musical question
	- consequent: second phrase, a musical response
# Harmony
- **Chord:** simultaneous sounding of two or more notes
	- *Triad:* three-note chords: most common chords in music of this class
	- can have qualities like major and minor
- *chord progression:* Sequence of chord movement throughout a piece
- *harmonic rhythm:* rate which chords change
- **Cadence:** harmonic configuration that finishes a phrase
	- chord that ends
	- *Authentic:* resolved
	- *Plagal:* resolved "Amen" cadence
	- *Imperfect:* unresolved
	- *deceptive*: unexpected, unresolved
- **Arpeggio:** a chord whose notes are sounded successively rather than simultaneously
	- harp-like effect
- **Modulation:** process of changing from one key to another
	- typically used at the end of a song going up usually to build energy
- Usually harmony backs up melody, but harmony can be in the foreground essentially as the melody
# Tonality
**Tonality:** organization of music aaround a single pitch (the tonic)
- We use the terminology of being "in a key"
Keys are a hierarchy, with some notes being more important than others
- **Tonic:** central pitch around which the melody gravitates, the first degree of the scale
- *Dominant*: fifth degree of the scale built on the tonic
- *Leading Tone*: seventh and final degree of the scale built on the tonic: resolves upward to the tonic
*Key Signature:* arrangement of sharps and flats at the beginning of each staff that defines the principal notes employed in the piece
**Consonance:** combination of notes which are in harmony with each other
**Dissonance:** lack of harmony among notes
**Atonality:** absence of tonality / of key or tonal center
- sprechstimme: use of voice midway between speech and song
	- Example in: **Pierrot lunarie by Schoenberg**
