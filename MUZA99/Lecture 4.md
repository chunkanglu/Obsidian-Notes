# Rhythm and Metre
## Foundations
- music exists in time, temporal, like dance, theatre, acts,...
	- define viewers time
	- you may be structured in when views clap, performer actions, acceptable behaviours
- other art form exist out of time like paintings
	- viewers can define and structure their own time
- Music specified time shorter than seconds
	- much of rest of life is not defined as precise
- **Tempo:** speed at which music is performed
	- rate per unit of time of metrical pulses in performance
	- typically remains constant
	- *Accelerando:* gradual becoming faster
		- often used to build tension
		- Example: Kalinka - Ivan Larionov
	- *Ritardando*: slower
		- often used at beginning or end of a piece, to give expressive freedom
		- sense of resolution
		- **River by Joni Mitchell**
	- **Rubato:** "robbed" time, played freely out of time
		- used as expressive device
		- Spartacus Love Theme by Bill Evans
		- often used at beginning of end of piece to give expressive freedom
	- Measured in BPM beats per minute
		- conductors and musicians must know the tempo before starting to play music
- Duration
	- **Rest:** span of time with silence, with symbol specifying duration
	- Phrases represent long durations
		- listen for pauses in melody, lyrics, harmonic resolutions, changes in strumentation
- **Beat:**  metrical pulse
	- felt if not played, brain percieves it
	- often represented by drums or other phythmic instruments
	- different roles in different genres
		- less foreground in classical, more in pop and hip-hop
	- quarter note usually carries the beat
## Rhythm
- **Rhythm:** pattern of movement in time, controlled movement of music in time
	- present throughout our lives like in our body like heartbeat, animals, vehicle
	- more gradual rhythms in nature
	- rhythm subdivides music into groups usually units of 2 and 3, grou
	- in typical melodies rhythm varies widely and relatively consistently
		- Example: Hymn to Freedom By Oscar Peterson
## Metre
- **Metre:** pattern in which rhystmic pulses are organized into groups
- **Bar:** unit of mesical time consisting of a fixed number of note-value, delineated with abrlines
- **Duple metre:** basic unit of pulse recurs in groups of 2, $\frac{2}{4}, \frac{4}{4}$
- **Triple metre:** basic unit of pulse recurs in groups of 3, $\frac{3}{4}$
- **Time Signature:** sign at the start of a piece of music to indicate metre
- **Downbeat:** first metrically strongest beat of a bar
	- feels heavier
- **Upbeat:** one or several notes before downbeat (pickup)
## Extended Concepts
- **Syncopation:** momentary contradiction of prevailing metre
	- insertion of sound in a place we don't expect it to be
	- builds monentum
	- contrast surrounding texture
	- Often in ragtime, blues, jazz
- **Accent:** emphasis or stress placed on musical note
- *Polyrhythm
- *Polymetre*
- *Metric Modulation*
