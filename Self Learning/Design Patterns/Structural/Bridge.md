- To divide a monolithic class into abstraction and implementation which can be independently changed
	- usually implementation only contains the most primitive operations with more sophisticated actions in the abstraction
- Abstraction contains an instance of a concrete implementation of the implementation interface
- Extremely similar to the [[Strategy]] pattern, but differs in intent
	- Strategy allows you to "hotswap" method implementations whereas this focuses on decoupling components
