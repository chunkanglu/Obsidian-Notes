# PCP
**Given** a finite set of tiles that each have a string at the top and bottom.
**Can we** find a non-empty sequence of tiles that when put side-by-side, has matching top and bottom strings

> PCP is undecidable

We can use this to define computability for non-directly-TM things; if we can map it to PCP, we can also solve it with a TM.
