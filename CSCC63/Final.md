- NP
	- Show is in NP (5 steps)
	- Prove NP-hard 
- Polytime reduction
- Self-reduction $FNP$
	- Find solution for language given oracle
	- Any NP-complete is self-reducible â€” that is, if we could decide it in polytime, we could also solve the corresponding problem in FNP. We saw examples of these reductions when we looked at how to find the largest clique in a graph G in tutorial.
- Generalized Geography
