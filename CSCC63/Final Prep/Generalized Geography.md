- A picks $\exists$ and $\lor$ clauses
- B picks $\forall$ and $\land$ clauses
- Not switches roles

- When connecting back to variables at end of clauses consider the role of the player that just made the decision before this
	- If A last chose & now at variable (no negate), want to make it true so arrow to same variable 
	- If A last chose **with** negate, want to make it false, so arrow to negated variable
	- If B last chose (no negate), want to make it false so arrow to negated variable
	- If B last chose **with** negate, want to make it true so arrow to same variable
