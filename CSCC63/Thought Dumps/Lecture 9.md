# Why PCP undecidability important
- Good starting point for mapping reductions that don't use TMs
- Many CFG problems decidable
	- decidable in cubic time if a string is in a CFG
	- can tell if CFG empty
	- can answer if generate inifite amount of strings
- But some aren't
	- No general algo that can tell us given 2 CFGs if there's any string generated by both
		- Can theoretically reduce from HALT, but its not obvious how to embed TM operations between 2 CFGs
	- context free ambiguity is also undecidable
- If PDA for a grammar is deterministic, we can invert them, thus complement of the languages of the grammar is also a context free language
