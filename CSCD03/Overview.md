# Skill based evaluation
- mark of points where course grades average of averages *bad no good*
- new skill based evaluation
	- course grade is based on set of skills demonstrated
	- removing numbers since arbitrary
	- A = Attempt made
	- S = Satisfactory
	- G = Good
	- V = Very Good
	- E = Exemplary
- on assignments, presentations, term paper, participation
	- marked in
		- research - are you supporting points
			- depth + breadth of research (how much you understand / how you find info)
			- **SHOW** that you read and understood (**WRITE NOTES**)
			- Proper citations
			- Support all claims with data
		- cognition - are you presenting in well thought way
			- *Bloom's taxonomy*
		- preparation
			- mostly effort based
			- polish & practice (well practiced and planned out points)
- **(almost) everything allows for resubmission**
	- get initial mark after a week, and can resubmit before/after feedback usually like 2 weeks after
	- Between assignment resubmission after visiting writing centre/librarian/OH
	- Presentation can be re-recorded video or re-submit slides
	- Term paper components
		- each component goes into next component
		- technically resubmissions
		- no resubmission for final paper
- participation is a survey-ish
# Why course diff
- capstone course
- big focus on skill development
- **we treat everything as an optimization problem**
	- 1st year has a focus on calc which is a fundamental part of optimization
- focus on broader application
	- stop and think about things, macro over the micro that we have mostly been focusing on the technical in the main courses
- Learn how to ask questions
# Topics
Most of a learning how to communicate course with the premise of computer ethics

How to ask questions
**How to know when there are questions to be asked**
- There is almost always something broader that can be asked about
Where to look for answers
How to research
How to present facts
How to present opinions
How to discuss topics
**It is not about finding answers as most things don't have concrete answers**
