# What is it
- legal right for owners of devices to freely modify and repair products
	- not limited to consumer electronics, but also things like cars, healthcare equipment, and farming equipment
- To support these:
	- device should be constructed and designed in a way to allows repairs to be made easily
		- using less proprietary parts and instead for standardized things like USB-C port
	- People should be able to access original space parts & tools reasonably
	- Efficacy of repairs should be the limited by software
	- Manufacturer should clearly communicate the repairability of the device, possibly even providing things like schematics
- How many people in this room use a Mac or an iPhone?
	- When you were thinking of buying a computer or phone, was repairability or aftermarket parts in your consideration
- How many people have a gaming laptop right now?
	- Did you care if you could say add more RAM or swap an SSD easier?
- Show phone transition to non-removable batteries
- Framework laptop & Fairphone

# Pros for Consumers
## Consumer Savings & Extending Device Lifespan
- This one is straightforward, by being able to easily fix something, you can use it for longer and save some money by not **needing** to buy a new product or going to the manufacturer for a really expensive repair.
	- For an analogy, if you have a car, if your tires go flat or run out of traction, you usually don't buy a whole new car. Its basically the same principle here.
- In many cases, you can repair common consumer electronics using guides from organizations like iFixit with some tools and a bit of time
	- speaking from experience, on my old phone I've swapped buttons when I mashed one in, and also swapped the battery. The only reason why I swapped was because the mainboard was acting up and sourcing it is expensive
- Goes hand in hand with the used market
- Now of course if you use this as a time to get an upgrade then you're not really part of the main population advocating for Right for Repair. But this leads well to the next point
## Environmental Benefits
- Reduces the amount of electronic waste
- *INSERT NUMBER STATISTIC*
- Even if you don't want to use it, the problem could be easily fixed and be a good product or an upgrade for another person
	- One man's trash is another man's treasure
## Supporting Local Businesses / Repair Shops

## Time sensitivity (for healthcare & farmers)
