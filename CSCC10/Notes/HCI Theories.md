High level overarching ideas
- ***Descriptive*** - Develop consistent terminology for objects and actions
- ***Explanatory*** - Describe sequences of event and cause and effect
- ***Prescriptive*** - Give designers clear guidance for their choices
- ***Predictive*** - Enable designers to compare proposed designs for execution times and error rates
## Design-by-levels Theories
1. Conceptual level - user's mental model of the system
2. Semantic level - describes meanings conveyed by user's input and computer's output
3. Syntactic level - defines how words that convey semantics are assembled into a complete sentence that instructs the computer to perform a certain task
4. Lexical level - Deals with device dependencies and with the precise mechanisms by which a user specifies the syntax
## Stages-of-action Theories
Norman's seven stages of action
## Consistency Theories
Inconsistent action verbs make things longer to learn, cause more errors, slow down users, and are harder to remember.
## Contextual Theories
Micro-HCI Theories
- Focus on measurable performance on multiple standard tasks taking second or minutes in laboratory environments
Macro-HCI Theories
- Focus on case studies of user experience over weeks and months, in realistic usage context with rich social engagement
