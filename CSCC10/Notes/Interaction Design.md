Process on discovering requirements, designing to fulfill requirements, producing prototypes and evaluating them
# Characteristics
- Users should be involved all the way from start to finish
- Usability and user experience goals are discussed, agreed, and documented
- Iterative mindset and process
# People Involved (Stakeholders)
- people influenced by success of failure of project
- users, developers, executives, legislators (ie. not just the users)
- Involving all people is not easy
# Why do this
- Be able to directly fit the needs of the userbase
- Recognize that one size does not fit all and diverse range of needs and capabilities
- Correct assumptions if needed
- Users have realistic expectations
- Users accept product (and possible flaws) better 

# Design Frameworks
