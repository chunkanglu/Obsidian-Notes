Process that takes the needs, wants, and limitations of end users in each part of design phase.
- Early focus on users and tasks
- Empirical measurement of performance, prototypes
- Iterative design to conduct tests and continuously fix found problems
## Establishing Requirements
- Gather data from users & analysis
- Understand users, tasks, and context for product
- Functional and non-functional requirements
	- Functional - what the system can do
	- Non-Functional - ensure system uptime, fast speed, easy access
#### Defining Users
- Target audience characteristics (age, background, tech-knowledge) and physical or cognitive capabilities
- Use [[Personas]], [[Scenarios]], [[Task Analysis]]
#### Gathering Data
Decide how to get data, who to get data from.
Triangulation - Cross reference different data gathering methods.
###### Interviews
###### Focus Groups
###### Surveys
###### Direct Observation
In the field
- See users in their natural setting
- Ethnography observation
	- Immerse in the culture and get video/data logs
	- Can be amongst them or as an outsider
Controlled Environment
- "Think-aloud technique"
	- Ask participant to explain all their thoughts when using product
	- Can be distracting and unnatural to user
###### Indirect Observation
Track user activities behind the scenes
- Interaction logs, web analytics
###### Contextual Inquiry
- User is the expert, designer is apprentice
- Interview where designer goes to user natural workspace and let user use product
- Allows for direct observation of user when doing tasks
- Takes a long time with a lot of coordination
## Designing Alternatives & Prototyping
#### What is a Prototype
- Screen sketches
- cardboard mock up
- Slideshow
- Storyboard
- Something stakeholders can see, interact with and can show the experience more than just text or a drawing
#### Why Prototype
- Early feedback
- Tangible reference and sign of progress
- Encourages reflection of design and be able to compare alternatives
#### Low Fidelity Prototypes
- Uses cheap, easily replaceable medium like paper or cardboard
##### Storyboard
- Series of sketches showing how a user might do a task with the product
##### Wizard of Oz Prototyping
- User thinks they are interacting with the product when it is actually a person manually controlling the system
- Lots of pre-preparation needed for templates
- Long response time
#### Medium Fidelity Prototypes
- Wireframes
#### High Fidelity Prototypes
- Similar to final product with interactive features
- May give false impression to users that this is the finished product when it still may have flaws
#### Conceptual Design
- Outline the features, surrounding concepts, feeling of the product
- Interface metaphors
	- Use familiar user knowledge to make product easier to understand
- What are the functions of the product
- How are these functions related
- What information or data is needed to do these things
#### Concrete Design
- The actual look, feel, and usability
- Themeing, following guidelines, accessibility, cultural rules
#### Explore User Experience
- Using personas, scenarios, visual representations
