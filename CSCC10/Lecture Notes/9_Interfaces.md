What interface to use as part of the product?
Depends on user and task as well as needed features
# Types
- Command based
- WIMP & GUI
- Multimedia
- Information visualization & dashboards
- Web
- Consumer electronics and appliances
- Mobile
- Speech
- Pen
- Touch
- Air based gesture
- Multi-modal
- Shareable
- Virtual reality
- Augmented reality
- Wearables
- Robots and drones
# Command based
- code-like
- efficient, precise
- high skill floor, high skill ceiling
- Little setup needed
## Research and design issues
- Labeling and meaning of commands
- The command shortcut the developer thinks of itself should make sense and efficient
- Consistency (ie. running command in different places)
- First letter of command (eg. for autofill)
- Popular of web scripting
# WIMP & GUI
Windows, icons, menus, pointing device (WIMP) lead to GUIs
- Windows
	- scrollable, opened, overlapping
	- Window management (switch attention without getting distracted)
		- spacing, grouping, simplicity
- Icons
	- application representations, objects tools
	- Research and design
		- guideline, style guides, captions, hover text
- Menus
	- lists of options that can be selected
	- flat menus, expending menus, cascading, contextual, scrolling, categorized
		- flexibility in navigation
		- how many top level, sub level until we lose the user
		- navigation by selection
			- step by step input and tailoring of output
	- Research and design
		- best names, labels
		- placement (quit and save far apart)
		- what type to use (eg. when lots of options, depending on tasks)
- Pointing device
	- mouse controlling cursor
GUI
- more varied but with same building blocks of WIMPs
- dynamicness, animation, interactiveness, toolbars, hovering
- Layout
# Multimedia
Single interface with various form of interactivity (eg. graphics, text, video, sound, animations)
- rapid access to multiple representations of information (good for accessibility, easier larning, engagement)
## Research & Design
- needs to be in sync
- cannot be too distracting
- guidines when combining media
- what types of media to combine
# Information Visualization & Dashboards
Computer-generated interactive graphics of complex data
- Enables users to see patterns
- Display a lot of information to user in a condensed form
- enhance discover, decision-making, and explanation
## Research & Design issues
- whether to use animation or interactivity
- use of color
- 2d vs 3d representation
- forms of navigation (eg. zooming)
- how much additional text
- navigational metaphor
# Web
Early websites largely text-based with hyperlinks
- how best to structure information to enable susers to navigate and access easily and quickly
- Web advertising
## Research & Design Issues
- how best to present, structure, navigate (to website and within website)
- content itself
# Consumer Electronics and Appliances
Everyday devices (washing machines), personal devices (digital camera), 
- Needs to be useable with minimal learning
## Research & Design
- design with short interactions
- simple
- trade off between soft and hard controls (physical buttons vs. touchscreen)
# Mobile
Increasingly used in all aspects of everyday life
- limited real estate
	- innovative physical designs
- used on the move (efficiency top priority)
- hand dexterity (eg. how large of an icon) and hit registration
- How much to display, what to display, how large to display
	- big enough to accurately press
	- small enough to provide enough information
# Speech
Talks with system with spoken language
- inquiring about very specific information (eg. performing a specific action)
- used by people with disabilities
- Mobile assistants
## Research & Design
- how to design systems that can keep conversation on track
- resonate with people
- allow to navigate appropriately and recover from errors
- personalization (type of voice actor)
# Pen
- Enable people to write, draw, select, move objects in interfacte
- capitalize on well-used drawing skills throughout life
- quick annotations
- difficult to see options on screen (hand blocking)
- can lag and feel clunky
## Research & Design
- Touch & feel of pen
# Touch
- Multi-touch support
- dynamic actions (double tap, swipe, combinations)
## Research & Design
- size of device, landscape or portrait
- location of device (kiosk)
- scrolling and other 
- cumbersome, error prone, slower to type with virtual keyboard
# Air-based gestures
Touchless system that recorgnizes gestures
- Surgeons can interact with and manipulate MRI or CT images
## Research & Design
- How does computer recognize and delineate user gestures
- why type of gestures
- what to assign to what gestures
- Does holding a control devie feel more intuitive
# Multi-modal
- Proved enriched and complex user experiences
## Research & Design
- complexity
- syncing
- need to reognize and analyse speech, gesture
- it it natural way to interacting with compute
# Shareable
Designed for more than one person to use
- smartboard
- co-located work
## Research & Design
- size origentation, and shape of display
- horizonal surfaces compared with vertical ones
- split design
# Virtual Reality
Computer generate graphical simulations of being part of an environment
- immersive
- sense of pr;esence
- headset itself may not be
- motion sickness
- cleanliness
## Research & Design
- how to design safe and realistic VR to facilitate training (flight sim, phobia)
- How best to navigate (first person, 3rd)
- how to control interactions and movements
- how much realism
# Augmented & Mixed Reality
- Application in medicine, flying, everyday exploring
	- augmented map, car HUD
- Virtual representations overlayed on physical objects or real and virtual combined
