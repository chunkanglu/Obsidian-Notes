- integrating data mining
- viewing big data (many dimensions)
- achieveing universal usability 
- supporting casual vs. advanced users
- Storytelling & dissemination
- Adapting to any device
- Evaluation
# 5 phase framework for search UI

2. Executing the search
3. Retrieve results

- Each phase requires a user interface
# Faceted Search
- ability to filter down using multiple filters to narrow/widen the result set
# Visualization techniques to illustrate different data types
- treemaps, graphs, bar charts, tag clouds, network diagrams
# Challenges in data visualization
- cluttered (feature rich tools)
- different types of users and different types of devices to be displayed on
- data cleaning
