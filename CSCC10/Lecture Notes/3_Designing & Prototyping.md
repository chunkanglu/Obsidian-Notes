# Prototype
- Can be
	- series of sketches
	- storyboard
	- slide show
	- video
	- cardboard mock-up
	- limited functionality software
### Why Prototype
- Evaluation and feedback
- stakeholder can interact with prototype more than just documents
- tangible reference for team
- encourages reflection of design
- support designers when choosing between alternatives

### Fidelity
##### Low Fidelity
- uses medium unlike final medium
- paper, cardboard, sticky notes
- create and discard quickly and cheaply
- Storyboarding
	-  series of sketches to tell story of how users interacts with tool
- Wizard of Oz Prototyping
	- users think they are interacting with computer
	- dev is operating the interface manually 
	- long responsive time, need templates prepared
##### High Fidelity
- prototype looks like final product
- developed by integrating hardware and software components
- more thorough user testing 
- users may think they are using final system when it is not

##### Medium Fidelity
- Wireframe

### Conceptual Design
Conceptually how will the user feel or different aspects when they use the product
- features of product, what concepts are needed to understand product
- details of the design
- mood board to capture feel

##### Interface Metaphors
- combines familiar user knowledge in prototype
- lets user understand product in more intuitive way
- what functions in product
- how are functions related
- what data is needed to perform task

### Concrete Design
Does the actual design follow the guidelines, accessible
- how design actually looks
- more on look and feel
	- accessibility
 
### Scenarios
- imagined situations for product and users
- ensures prototype fills needs of users
##### Explore user experience
- user personas
- visual representations
- experience map drawn as a wheel or timeline
	- keep user and task in mind
