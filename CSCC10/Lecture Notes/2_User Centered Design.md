# Different types of design
## Interaction Design
- Solutions centered on interface and human interaction with user interface
- Focus on interaction
## User Interface Design
- Ensuring easy to access, understand elements to facilitate actions of interface
- Focus on Functionality
## User Experience Design
- Enhance user satisfaction, usability, and overall quality of life
- Emphasis on Experience
# Interaction Design
- Blend of technical usability but also on aesthetics
- Discovering, designing solutions for requirements
- Balance conflicting requirements
#### Types of Design
- 4 Types:
	- User/People/Human centered design 
	- Activity centered
	- Systems design
	- Genius Design
#### Stakeholders
- Identify stakeholders (not only users, but also other people like executives)
- Involving stakeholders
- Allows us to correct and identify problems
- Give them realistic expectations
	- They may be more likely to forgive problems if they also understand
- Makes users bond more and accept the product
#### User Involvement
- Multiple levels of user involvement
	- in design team
	- Online contributions (like crowd sourcing)
	- A/B testing
	- Customer reviews
#### Design Frameworks 
- User Centered Design
	- Users influence design team but not directly
	- Grounded in users
- Participatory Design
	- Participants as part of design team
	- Users can deviate the idea of product
	- Users are directly able to describe what works or doesn't instantly as they are right there
	- Who are the participants (different samples can skew design in different ways)
	- Requires single time when all people are together to organize everything
- Agile Interaction Design
	- Agile development, quick short bursts of user involvement, but less than others
# 3 Principles Gould and Lewis
- Early focus on users and tasks
	- study and identify characteristics
- Empirical measurement 
	- measure user performance to scenarios, simulations and prototypes
- Iterative design
	- iterate and fix problems found from tests

# Design Lifecycle Model
1. Discover requirements
	1. analysis through surveys, interviews, task analysis, ...
2. Design Alternatives
	1. wireframing, storyboarding, ...
3. Prototyping
	1. low/medium fidelity interactive prototype
4. Evaluating
	1. Usability testing, heuristic evaluation
5. Repeat

# Gathering Requirements
- Understand users, task, and **context** (where is solution used) and produce stable set or requirements
	- Data gathering/analysis activities
	- Iterative process
	- Customer may not concretely know what they want
- Types:
	- Functional requirements
		- functionality of product, what system should do
	- Non-functional requirements
		- security, response time, access
	- UX requirements
		- ensure experience is positive (8 golden rules)
# Users
- Characteristics of users
- Different users may provide different levels of users feedback
- Abilities/Disabilities 

# Personas
- Capture a set of user characteristics and bring fictional target user to life
- Perception of userbase in different ways
- To make sure we accommodate for all types of users
- More realistic context on users
- Puts everyone on the same page to build for target audience in mind
# Scenarios
- non-general story that illustrates some specific user(s) (with specific characteristics) using the system
	- abstract away fine details
- make realistic and not idealized

# Task Analysis
- Breaking product into tasks and subtasks for what interfaces are needed to build
- how interfaces connect
- Work breakdown structure
#### Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA)

# Data Gathering
- Types
	- Interview (structured, semi-structured, unstructured)
	- Focus Groups
	- Survey
	- Direct/Indirect Observations (Data recording)
- Identify what info we want to gather
- Identify participants and relationship with them
- Triangulation - Cross check between different techniques
- Pilot studies to test technique
###### Interview
- structured, unstructured, semi-structured
- good for going in-depth
- time consuming and hard to prepare
###### Focus Groups
- Group interviews
- Consensus view, but there can be loud minority swaying balance
- Using props like a prototype or scenario to enrich experience
###### Surveys
- easy to create and distribute for responses
- sample population issues
###### Observation
- Direct observation in the field
	- see users in their actual setting (as an insider among them or outsider)
	- ethnography - philosophy with set of techniques including participant observation and interviews to get most info
		- immerse in the culture
		- video and data logs
		- time consuming
		- very data rich
- Direct observation in controlled environment
	- test lab situation
	- The "Think-aloud" technique
		- Get user to elaborate as they are doing their task
		- highlights user frustrations and pain points
		- may distract user and be unnatural
- Indirect observation
	- behind the scenes
	- logging, analytics
	- very aggregated metrics instead of individual
- Combine techniques for triangulation
	- depends on
		- focus of study
		- number of participants
		- nature of techniques
		- time/resources available
##### Contextual Inquiry
- ethnographic study
- interview that takes place in user environment
	- goes to user workspace and interview user in their space
	- takes 2-3 hours
	- 
- 4 principles
	- Context: see workplace and what happens
	- Partnership: collaboration between user and dev
	- Interpretation: observation interpreted together
	- Focus:
- know all information with context environment, dynamics
