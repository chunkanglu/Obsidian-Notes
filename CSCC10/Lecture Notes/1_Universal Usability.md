# Usability of Interactive Systems
> How easy, convenient, intuitive user interfaces are to use.
- How people understand and use the technology, **not the technology itself**
> Qualitative & Quantitative measure to judge a design's effectiveness
- Qualitative measure
	- Satisfaction, quick to learn, remembering how to use it
- Quantitative measure
	- Efficient, Safety
## Importance of Usability
- People leave website or application  if it is hard to use, user can get lost, hard to read
- Part of budget should be on usability

## Factors
- Users
	- Types of users
	- Satisfaction
- Task
	- Are the tasks simple or complex
- Organization
	- Will users be trained
	- Politics
	- Rules
	- Gray areas
- Environmental
	- Is light, noise, health and safety factors an issue
- Constraints
	- any technical constraints
	- budget
	- staffing (people)
- System functionality
	- Hardware limitations
- User Interface
	- IO device
	- Icons, language
- Comfort
	- Designing for small screens
- Productivity
	- what are we trying to improve on
## Goals & Measures
- Good designers must understand who the users are and the tasks to be performed
- Ensure reliability
	- availability
	- privacy issues
- Standardization
	- Use pre-existing industry standards to avoid errors
- Integration
	- able to run across different tools
- Consistency
- Portability
	- users can learn across different environments
##### LEMES
1.  Learnability
	- How quick to learn (intuitive)
2. Efficiency
3. Memorability
	- Can one remember how to use after not using for a period of time
	- How easy to remember how to use, once learned
4. Errors
5. Satisfaction
	- How pleasant to use
## User Experience
> How users are perceiving/judging the product.
> Simple, practical, safe
- 

## Core Characteristics of interaction design

# Universal Usability
- Is product able to be used by as much of the target userbase
## Accessibility vs. Inclusiveness
- Accessibility - accessible by as many people as possible
- Inclusiveness - accommodate widest possible number of people
### Variations in physical ability & workplace
- Target users/population
- Left handed, colorblindness, user dexterity (hand size), human size
### Cognitive perceptual abilities
- Memory, problem solving
### Personality
- Frustrated easily (tolerance)
- Personality types
### Cultural & International Diversity
- Cultural differences (languages)
- Date/Weight format
- Phone number area code
- Where is product going to be used (internet availability)
### Disabilities
- Comply with Disabilities Act
- W3C disability design
### Age group
- Designing specifically for younger/older
- Font size, brightness, color, distraction
- Gameafication for children learning
# Guidelines, Principles, Theories
## Guidelines
- Focused advice about good and bad practices
- promote consistency
- based on best practices
- can be too specific, incomplete, or hard to apply
- Accessibility Guidelines - non-text elements should have text counterpart
- Mobile HCI Guidelines - designing for smaller screens
## Principles
- Strategies or rules to compare design alternatives
- fundamental principles
	- Determine user skill level (first time, knowledgeable, physical capabilities)
	- Identify the tasks (frequency, difficulty)
	- Choose interaction style (direct manipulation, form fill, commands, natural language)
- 5 primary interaction styles
- 8 golden rules of interface design
	- Consistency
	- universal usability
	- offer informative feedback
	- dialog yield closure 
	- prevent errors
	- easy reversal of actions
	- keep user in control
	- reduce short term memory load
## Theories
- High level, broad frameworks used when designing and evaluating
 -
