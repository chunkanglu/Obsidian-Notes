Consider some aspect of an greedy solution that can be iteratively applied to the optimal solution without destroying optimality (optimality preserving steps).

If no steps needed, then the greedy is the optimal.

Either:
1. Prove that there cannot be a case that there are more than 1 step (or else it contradiction) assuming that the optimal has the **fewest** number of this aspect
2. Prove we can iteratively apply these steps preserving optimality and will eventually get to greedy solution
