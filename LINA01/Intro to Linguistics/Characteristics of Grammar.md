# Generality
- all languages/dialects have a grammar
# Parity
- all grammars are equal
- no such thing as a "primitive" language
# Mutability
- Grammars change over time
- Changes are within limits
- languages are never perfected (and thus never subject to corruption or deterioration)
# Inaccessibility
- Grammatical knowledge is unconscious
- Cannot be figured out by *thinking* about it
# Universality
- grammars are alike in basic ways in spite of apparent distinctions
- all languages share an inventory of principles and properties
