# Prescriptive Grammar
- Strict and formal form
- defines one form to be more logical than another (there are *correct* and *incorrect* ways of speaking)
- appeals classical/older forms and against use of foreign/borrowed words
# Descriptive Grammar
- characterizes language of specific groups of people in a range of situations
- no preconceived notions of correctness where one is better than another
1. All varieties of a language are valid systems (with their own logic and conventions)
2. No strong reason to expect one language to match the mold of another
3. Languages are continually changing without reducing their usefulness, preciseness, or aesthetic value
4. All languages have adopted words from other sources
