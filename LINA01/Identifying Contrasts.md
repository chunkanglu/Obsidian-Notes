1. Identify minimal pairs
	1. If find a pair with same environment but only differ with that sound and meaning changes, then they minimal pairs (separate phonemes)
2. If no minimal pairs, list environments (stuff that come before and/or after the sound)
3. Find patterns
	1. Could be stuff like "always after front vowels", or "always before a consonant" (literally could be anything in terms of pattern)
4. Generalize
	1. Want to find one sound that always occur in a particular environment, whereas the other sound never occurs in that same environment
	2. Not same environment $\implies$ complementary distribution (thus allophones)
	3. If allophones, the one that has the pattern has the more limited environment and the other is the actual phoneme
