- analysis of the structure (constituency) of words
- Word formation
	- how units of meaning combine to form words
# Morpheme
- smallest grammatical unit of meaning
- cannot be further broken down and analyzed
## Allomorphs
 - variants of morphemes
 - Example
	 - a vs. an in Engligh
## Free Morphemes
- Can stand alone (can constitute words by themselves)
- Examples
	- book, scream, leaf, happy
## Bound Morphemes
- Cannot stand alone, but can attach to other morphemes to form words
- Examples
	- -ish, -able, -ness, un-
# Word
- smallest free form in language
- can stand on its own
- can appear in different positions (not restricted to surroudings)
- Composed of one or more [[#Morpheme|morphemes]]
	- 1 morpheme - simple word
	- 2 or more morphemes - complex word
## Word Structure
- Complex words contain a **root** and one of more **affixes**
- **Root** - lexical category morpheme (noun, verb, adv, adj, pre) that cannot be broken down
	- Content word
	- Can be looked up in a dictionary
- **Affix** - bound morpheme that cannot be broken down
	- No lexical category
- **Affixation** - is when morphemes attach to other morphemes or words
	- order of how affixes are attached matter
	- can be represented with a tree
	- **Base** - the form that an affix attaches to
		- can be the root or larger than the root
# Affixes
## 4 types
- **Prefix** - before other morphemes
- **Suffix** - after other morphemes
- **Infix** - inserted into a root of a word
	- Not in English
- **Circumfix** - attach on both sides
## Classes of Affixes
### Derivational Affixes
- Attach to morpheme to create new word with **different meaning or lexical category** from the base
### Inflectional Affixes
- Attach to morpheme and **do not change the category of the base**
- Only to express grammatical information
- *Usually attach after derivational morphemes*
- Examples
	- -s (for noun plural)
	- -er (for adjective comparison)
	- -ing (for verb present)
