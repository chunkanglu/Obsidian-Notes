# Derivational
- forms new word with a meaning or syntactic category different from base
- Complex derivation
	- Combine multiple derivations
	- Ordering determined by rules on what the affixes can be applied to (syntactic category)
## Derivational affixation (prefixation, suffixation, ...)
- prefix, suffix combines with a base to create new word
- Example: treat, -ment (treatment)
## Acronym
- derived from initial of other words
- *pronounced like a word*
- Example: NASA
## Abbreviation
- formed using the first letter of each word
- *read letter by letter*
## Coinage
- New words from scratch that did not already exist in the language (eg. product, company names)
- Examples: Kleenex, Kodak, Teflon, Grinch
## Eponym
- common words derived from proper names
- Examples: sandwich (Earl of Sandwich), jacuzzi (Candido Jacuzzi)
## Blend
- parts of words are combined or deleted (similar to compounding)
- Example: motel (motor + hotel)
## Clipping
- removing syllables from existing word
- Examples: flu (influenza), math (mathematics)
## Backformation
- making a word by omitting what is *assumed* to be an affix even if it is not (was originally a simple word)
- Example:
	- edit (from editor)
	- self-destruct (from self-destruction)
	- donate (from donation)
## Zero Derivation (Conversion)
- assigns an existing word to a new syntactic category
- Examples:
	- ink (from noun to verb)
	- drink (from verb to noun)
	- dirty (from adjective to verb)
	- parent (from noun to verb)
	- email (from noun to verb)
	- Google (from noun to verb)
## Compounding
- Take 2 existing words and combines them
- Examples: cupboard, blackboard, nationwide
- Syntactic category of compound follows one of the existing parts
	- The morpheme that determines the category is the **head**
	- English is *mostly right-headed*
- **Endocentric** - meaning of compound is related to the *head*
- **Exocentric** - meaning of compound does not follow from the meaning of its parts in a straightforward way
	- Example: redneck
# Inflectional
- do not change the syntactic category of words they are attached to
- Example:
	- I sail the ocean
	- He *sails* the ocean
	- John *sailed* the ocean
	- John has *sailed* the ocean
	- John is *sailing* the ocean
- English only has 8 bound inflectional affixes
	- -s (waits)
	- -ed (waited)
	- -ing (doing)
	- -en (eaten)
	- -s (keyboards, plural)
	- -'s (John's)
	- -er (faster)
	- -est (fastest)
## Ablaut
- vowel alternation changes grammatical information
- Examples
	- Sing vs. sant
	- sink vs. sank
	- drive vs. drove
## Umlaut
- phonologically conditioned alternation from previous stage of language history
- Example: geese from goose
## Suppletion
- replaces a morpheme with entirely different morpheme to indicate grammatical contrast
- Examples
	- Good, better, best
	- Bad, worse , worst
	- German - ist 'is' $\implies$ sind 'are'
## Reduplication
- copying a free morpheme or a part of it to create new words
- *partial* (only a chunk repeated) or *full* (whole word repeated)
- Examples
	- Turkish - ʧabuk ‘quickly’ $\implies$ ʧabuk ʧabuk ‘very quickly’
	- Tagalog - takbuh ‘run’ $\implies$ tatakbuh ‘will run’
