# Phoneme & Allophone
- mental/phonemic represented with slanted brackets
- contrastive/distinct sounds that distinguish one word from another
	- if you swap a phoneme, it should become a different word with different meaning
- brain interpretes and breaks down words in abstract units (psychological entities) as **Phonemes**
	- book
		- $/ b u k /$
		- [b u k]
- Phonemic transcription
	- transcribing with individual IPA symbol sounds (in isolation)
- Phonetic transcription
	- transcribing actual pronunciation including all processes

- vowel nasalization rule
	- /i/ has different realizations/pronunciations: $[\tilde{i}], [i]$ depending on consonant after
	- these realizations are **allophones**, sounds assigned to the same phoneme
# Complementary Distribution
- Phonemes are not in complementary distribution if they can occur in the same position
	- bead $[bid]$, bad $[baed]$
		- the /i/ and /ae/ occur in the same place
	- bad $[baed]$, ban $[baen]$
- Allophones are in complementary distribution (where one can occur, another cannot)
	- $[i]$ vs. $[\tilde{i}]$
# Aspiration
- extra puff of air
- peak $[p^hik]$ vs. speak $[spik]$
- apart $[\shwa p^hart]$, upon $[\shwa p^h \tilde{a} n]$, tan $[t^h \tilde{a} n]$
- when voiceless stops, at the beginning of a stressed syllable
# Contrastiveness: Minimal Pairs
- Minimal pairs exactly the same except for one phoneme replacement, that change meaning
	- bead, bean
	- plead, bleed
	- nip, nib
	- pan, ban
-  if no change in meaning, then they are allophones
# Natural Classes
- sounds that have properties in common
# Liquid Devoicing
- liquids and glides $[l~r~w~j]$ (default voiced ) become devoiced immediately after voiceless stops
	- liquid has to occur in a stressed syllable, between a syllable-initial voiceless stop (aspiration) and a vowel
- Marked by a small circle under the liquid
- process directly related to aspiration
- example
	- blame vs. play (play's p makes the l become devoiced)
# Canadian  Raising
- In north american english
- /aj/ pronounced as $[\^ j]$ before voiceless consonants
	- knife [n^jf] vs. knives [najvz]
- same for /aw/ which can become [ ^w] (ooh)
	- cloud [klawd] vs. clout [kl^wt]
