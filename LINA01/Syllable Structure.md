# Segments and above segments
- how sounds are organized in words
- Sonorants
	- non-obstructed sounds (non-turbulent sounds)
	- consonants or vowels
	- all are voiced
	- usually louder
	- relatively-free escape of the airstream in the oral or nasal cavity
		- vowels
		- glides
		- liquids
		- nasals
	- support segments groups to form core of syllables
- Obstruents
	- obstruction of the airflow
		- stops
		- fricative
		- affricates
	- all consonants
# Sonority Hierarchy
- syllables have core/nucleus on sororant sounds
- scale from most to least sonorous
	- vowels
	- glides
	- liquids
	- nasels
	- Obstruents
		- fricatives
		- affricates
		- stops
- Number of vowels is number of syllables
- A vowel by itself can form a syllable
	- if it gets deleted (ie. from deletion)
		- bottle [ba r \shwa l] becomes [bar l] then the other sonorant after vowel replaces it and becomes syllabic consonant
		- denoted with bar or dot underneath
# Syllables
- vowel as nucleus (unless vowel is deleted)
- surrounding (marginal) sounds are less sonorous
- $\cdot$ denotes syllable boundary
## Syllable structure
- 2 major elements
	- onset
		- consonant
	- rhyme
		- split into nucleus and coda
		- coda is consonant
- for bin /b I n/

- for about /\shwa \cdot b a w t/

- for multiple consonants (consonant cluster) in onset or coda, do branching
## Syllable Facts
- all languages have syllables
- in all languages syllable structure is subject to constraints
- universal tendincies
	- syllable nuclei usually one vowel
	- syllables usually begin with oncets
	- syllables often end with codas
	- onsets and codas usually consist of one consonant
- Most syllables are CV (consonant vowel) or CVC
## Phonotactics
- set of constraints on how sequences of segments are allowed
- in English, onsets can contain more than one consonant
- If an onset in English contains 3 consonants, the structure is the following
	- the first is always voiceless alveolar fricative
		- always [s]
	- second always voiceless stop
		- [p t k]
	- third is liquid or glide
		- [l r j w]
## Syllabification
- universal syllable shape constraints requires onsets to be as large as possible
	- **Maximize Onset Principle**
	- if there is a coda in previous segment, then move to next onset if it is valid combination of consonants
