# Syllables
- Groups of segments in a word
- Require usually a vowel as their **nucleus** (or core) with less sonorous sounds surrounding it
# Structure of a Syllable
- Split into 2 main parts: **Onset**, **Rhyme**
	- Rhyme is split into: **Nucleus**, **Coda**
- Common tendencies
	- Syllable nucleus usually consists of one vowel
	- Syllable usually begin with onsets
	- Syllables often end with codas
	- Onsets and codas usually consist of one consonant
# Phonotactics
- Set of constraints on how sequences of segments can be formed
- If an onset in English contains 3 consonants, its structure must be
	1. [s], voiceless alveolar fricative
	2. [p t k], voiceless stop
	3. [l r j w], liquid or glide
# Syllabification
- Words containing multiple consonant clusters can theoretically be syllabified (split into separate syllables) in many ways
## Maximize Onset Principle
- Onsets should be as large as possible
- Every time a syllabification process has to choose between placing a segment in a coda or in an onset, the onset will be preferred *if it makes sense to do so*
# Syllabic Consonants
- Nasals and Approximants (glides & liquids) become syllabic (the nucleus) if the vowel is deleted, thus syllabic consonants
- Able as they are sonorant sounds
- Indicated with a small vertical line below the symbol
- Example
	- kitten /kɪtən/ → [kɪtn̩ ]  
	- crumple /krʌmpəl/ → [krʌmpl̩]
