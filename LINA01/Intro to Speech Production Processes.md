- Speech production is not a series of isolated events
- Articulation of one sound affects the surrounding sounds
- Often more than one articulator is active in order to speak fast
- Coarticulation - Sequence [pl] has no pause between articulation of two sounds
## Assimilation
- sound becoming more similar to another nearby sound
- Types of assimilation:
	- place assimilation
		- two sounds become in terms of place of articulation
		- in- (not prefix) changes depending on word
			- impossible (bilabial), intolerable (alveolar), irrelevant (alveolar), illegal (alveolar), incomplete (velar)
	- voicing assimilation
		- if both combine to become voicing or voiceless
		- plural /s/
			- cats [kaets] (voiceless), dogs [dagz] (voiced, watches
		- -ed
			- walked [walkt] (both voiceless), played [plejd] (both voiced)
	- manner assimilation
	- Vowel nasalization
		- A vowel becomes a nasal before a nasal consonant (in the same syllable)
		- nasializing effect that a nasal consonant has on adjacent vowels
			- vowel air partially escapes the nose instead of oral
		- when vowel followed by nasal consonant
		- tilde on top of the vowel IPA symbol $\tilde{a}$ 
		- regressive assimilation
### Regressive assimilation
right affects left
- have to, has to
### Progressive assimilation
left affects right
- walk + -ed, play + -ed
## Dissimilation
 Opposite of assimilation
 
## Deletion
- process removes a segment from a word
- schwa is often deleted in English (vowel reduction)
## Epenthesis
- process inserts a segment within the existing string of segments (opposite of deletion)
- for ease of articulation
- "something" may have "p" sound like "sump"
## Metathesis
- process reorders a sequrence of segments
- prescribe may sometimes be pronounced as "perscribe"
## Flapping / Tapping
identified with /r/ round
- when /t/ and /d/ can become a flap 
	- when two vowels surrounding /t/ or /d/, usually first vowel is stressed, second unstressed
- tongue lip strikes alveolar ridge as it passes across
- examples: butter, water, bitter, writer, rider
