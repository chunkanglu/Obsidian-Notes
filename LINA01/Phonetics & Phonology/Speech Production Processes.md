- In fast speech, we usually don't pronounce sounds in isolation but make adjustments to make the sounds *flow* better
- This is **coarticulation**
# Assimilation
- sound becoming more like another nearby sound
## Types of Assimilation
### Voicing Assimilation
- one sound assimilating to the voicing of the neighboring sound
- Example:
	- have to, [hæv tə] → [hæf tə] (voiced v becomes voiceless f before voiceless t)
	- has to, [hæz tə]→[hæs tə]
	- Plural -s becomes [-z] after *voiced* sounds, [-s] after *voiceless* sounds, and [-əz] after *sibilants* (dish-əz, church-əz)
### Place Assimilation
- two sounds become similar in place of articulation
- Example:
	- Negative prefix in-
		- [in-]tolerable
		- [iŋ-]compatible
		- [im-]possible
## Assimilation Direction
### Progressive
- sound before affects sound after
### Regressive
- sound after affects sound before
# Vowel Nasalization
- vowel becomes nasalized when it occurs before a nasal consonant (n, m, or ŋ)
- Special type of regressive Assimilation (in English)
- Vowel is then marked with a tilde on top $\tilde{a}$
# Dissimilation
- opposite of assimilation, two sounds becoming less alike (usually to make pronunciation easier)
- Example:
	- Fifth /fɪfθs/ as [fɪfts]  
	- Sixths /sɪksθs/ as [sɪksts]
# Deletion
- Removing a segment from a word
	- Schwa is often deleted in English in fast speech (Vowel Reduction): suppose [səpowz] → [spowz]
	- Difficult consonant clusters: fifths [fɪfθs] → [fɪfs]
# Epenthesis
- Inserting a segment within existing word
- Example
	- Something /sʌmθɪŋ/ → [sʌmpθɪŋ]  
	- Warmth /wɔrmθ/ → [wɔrmpθ]
# Metathesis
- Reordering a sequence of segments (in a word)
- Example (for some people)
	- Prescribe /prəskrajb/ → [pərskrajb]  
	- Prescription /prəskrɪpʃən/ → [pərskrɪpʃən]
# Flapping
- /t/ and /d/ can become a (voiced alveolar) flap [ɾ] (rolling tongue sound when tongue tip quickly strikes the alveolar ridge)
- Happens between vowels, when second vowel is unstressed
- Example:
	- butter, bedding
