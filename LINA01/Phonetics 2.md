Study of speech sounds
Consonants, vowels and glides
Consonants can be defined by:
- Places of articulation
- Manners of articulation
- Voicing

# Places of Articulation

## Glottal
- If narrow opening between two folds (glottis) is used
- $\textglotstop$ start of **hat** (ha), air passed through opening
- **ah** or **uh**, button, Latin, the stopping of air and voice using vocal chords and then release

# Voicing
- From vocal cords inside larynx (voice box)
- Whether the vocal folds are close enough to be vibrating (voiced) or not vibrating (voiceless)
- Vowels are voiced in English
# Manners of Articulation
- How consonants are produced
	- how the air flows (obstructed, blocked, flows easily)
- Oral vs. Nasal Sounds
	- When velum is raised, cutting off airflow to nasal cavity, resulting from mouth, **oral sound**
	- When velum is lowered, air gets to nasal cavity, **nasal sound**
		- Only 3 nasal sounds
		- Voiced
## Oral Stops (p b t d k g ?)

- Completely stopping airflow, buijdup of air pressure
	- audible pop (plosion)
- Nasal Stops m, n, $\eta$ also blockage of air
## Fricatives

- Air is not completely blocked, flows through narrow opening with turbulence
## Affricates

- Begin as stop, release as fricative
## Stridents (Sibilants)

- Nosier fricatives and affricates that make louder hissing or buzzing (high pitched turbulent noise)
## Approximants (Liquids) l, r
- Less constriction of airflow than fricatives
- {l} - Liquid, later (voiced)
- {r} - read, write
- For {l}, lateral liquid
	- air pass freely over sides of tongue
- For {r}, retroflex approximant
	- curl tip of tongue behind alveolar ridge
- Flap
	- When tip of tongue strikes alveolar ridge and passes across
	- butter, writer, water, bitter
# Glides
![[Pasted image 20231108203947.png]]
- Transitions, Semi-vowels or semi-consonants
- Very little obstruction of airflow
- {w} is both labio and velar
	- lips rounded, tongue raised and pulled back to velum
	- start of water, yellow
