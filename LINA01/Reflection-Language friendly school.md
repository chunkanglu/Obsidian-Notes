- It is estimated that over 200 million
school children do not receive education
in a language they understand.
- In many
countries, children are punished for speaking
their home language at school. Punishments
may vary from forcing children to stand
outside the school, taping up their mouths,
being barred from lunch, to being expelled
from school altogether.2 By encouraging
schools to become language friendly, we wish
to remedy these violations of human rights.
- Ellen-Rose Kambel
recognized the crucial role that the languages and cultures of
these peoples play in the well-being and self-determination
of their communities.
-  impact of national and local language policies
on teachers’ and schools’ appreciation or rejection of students’
languages and cultures. Together, they decided to reflect
on a model that would ensure the sustainability of inclusive
and anti-discriminatory measures in education.
- All schools should recognize and em-
brace their students’ multilingualism, and
take action to give space to their languages
within the school community.
- This begins with an
inventory of the languages present, and a cel-
ebration of the rich cultural diversity reflect-
ed by those languages. 
- Language Friendly Schools develop a
language plan involving all members of the
school: students, teachers, and staff. The plan
is adapted to the school’s own needs, with the
goal of creating an inclusive and language-
friendly learning environment for all stu-
dents. 
- The school assesses its current situation. The process
should start from the students’ perspectives. How do they
feel if they are forbidden to speak their home language in
the classroom or schoolyard?
- The interviews allowed us to un-
derstand the impact of language-
and culture-friendly pedagogy in
different contexts and the role
played by administrators. Their
testimonies show cognitive and
socio-emotional benefits of a
whole school approach to lan-
guage-friendly pedagogy—that
is, a team approach that includes
the entire school community
- “I went into school with
two languages, and I left
with one. This is the exact
opposite of what education
should do; it should add
things, not take away things.”
- Many of us
have grown up in monoglossic envi-
ronments (i.e., with a vision oriented
by one language and one culture).
Even the most multilingual among
us have internalized this vision.
- students and their families, as
well as all other stakeholders
in the school, bring their own
linguistic, academic, and cultural
experiences with them. They
may find it difficult to recognize
themselves in schools where
their languages, knowledge, and
worldviews are not reflected or
even may be rejected.
- For Krista, the most impor-
tant motivation for becoming a
language-friendly school was the
desire to see students develop
an identity based on who they
are when they arrive at school,
including their languages, their
norms, their habits, and the cul-
tures that have shaped them
- In Language Friendly
Schools, the main objective of
these negotiations is to welcome
the languages of the families as
valuable instruments for learn-
ing. Welcoming these languages
will allow students to show what
they can do and to be proud
of their linguistic and cultural
heritage. Students feel accepted
with their cultural background,
which allows them to develop a
sense of belonging and feel in-
cluded in the school community.
- more
informed diagnostic assessment
of students’ academic level.
- tudents realize
they can draw on differences and
similarities in different languages
and cultures, which allows them
to develop a deeper level of
metacognitive awareness. Teach-
ers also may be able to question
the ethnocentricity of their own
practices, opening doors to edu-
cation that is more focused on
global citizenship.
- In Language Friendly
Schools, we recognize that we
all—students, teachers, and
staff—need to be included and
our talents and knowledge rec-
ognized. This is why the action
of the Language Friendly School
is aimed at the environment and
not at the individual: the under-
lying assumption is that every-
one benefits from each other’s
knowledge when it is shared,
negotiated, and made visible.
